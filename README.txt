WHO does our app target: both consumers and small-medium sized business owners

WHAT does our app do: Provides both a contract job/gig board for seekers, and a suite of business tools to micro LLC owners

WHERE does our application operate: EVERYWHERE, we do not want to limit ourselves to certain cities

HOW will you advertise the business?: Gorilla marketing, go on tour to as many towns and cities in America, having a cookout and
talk about the app and how it can help everybody, document the entire journey onall social media outlets

The goal of this application is to provide a means for which people/groups of people can work for others or provide work
for others. When job SEARCHING, a bid structure will be in place, people will offer their available jobs, and people will
submit counter bids on an open market. small LLC. will take a small not yet determined percent from each job.

This idea may seem similar to other sites such as jobhopper or task rabbit, but the key difference is in the bid structure
for jobs, as well as the open ended nature of job seekers profiles, this allows for skilled workers to use this site to quickly
pickup contract work from anywhere in the world, as well as nonskilled workers to find work anywhere as well

Job seekers will be qualified as contract workers unless otherwise required by state/federal law

Both job seekers, as well as job providers will be able to provide reviews for one another

People will be able to fully flesh out their profiles with resumes, past experiences, links to projects, etc

Job posters will be able to specify skills required, or if the job is unskilled, as well as whether the job is short term or
long term

Users will be able to track jobs via close enough geo proximity i.e. see jobs on a map with an indication of their general
area

There will also be a category for REMOTE UNSKILLED jobs

Category for SOCIAL jobs, maybe someone is loney and just wants to sit around and talk, can charge a low rate to basically be friends, this
is great for elderly people or people suffering from debilitating illnesses
